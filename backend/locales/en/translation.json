Some employers may also seek specific educational qualifications and certifications. Here are the typical steps to becoming a CFO:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"color: #434343; background-color: transparent;\">Obtain Relevant Education:</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Many employers expect candidates to hold at least a bachelor's degree in a finance-related field. A common option for aspiring CFOs is a Bachelor of Science in finance or accounting, although degrees in economics or other business disciplines can also be valuable. To further enhance your skills as you gain experience, consider enrolling in online short courses in areas such as business risk management, compliance management, import/export management, and strategic business management. These courses can deepen your understanding of analysis, budgeting, compliance, and risk management.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"color: #434343; background-color: transparent;\">Gain Industry Experience:</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">You can start accumulating experience while pursuing your undergraduate degree, but building expertise in the industry after graduation is also crucial. Look for internships in accounting or finance to observe processes and practice tasks you might handle in the future. After completing your education, seek entry-level positions that offer opportunities for professional development or help you build a robust skill set. Consider roles such as:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Accounting assistant</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Staff accountant</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Tax preparer</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Financial analyst</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"color: #434343; background-color: transparent;\">Seek Leadership Opportunities:</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">CFOs are typically in high-authority positions, which require strong leadership skills. To develop your own leadership abilities, start in entry-level roles for the first few years before transitioning into managerial and leadership positions. This experience will help you practice essential people management and team leadership skills needed for a CFO role. Consider positions in accounting or treasury departments, such as:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Controller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Director of Finance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Internal Audit Manager.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">- Finance Manager.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"color: #434343; background-color: transparent;\">Explore Advanced Education:</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">As you gain professional leadership experience, think about pursuing advanced education, such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or a master&rsquo;s degree in finance or accounting. These programs usually take one to three years to complete, depending on the institution. Earning an advanced degree can enhance your business administration and finance management skills while allowing you to engage in case studies and projects that apply theoretical concepts in practical settings.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"color: #434343; background-color: transparent;\">Obtain Professional Certifications:</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Although professional certifications are not always required for a CFO, many pursue specialized credentials to enhance their expertise and attractiveness to employers. For instance, aspiring CFOs often become Certified Public Accountants (CPA) to deepen their practical knowledge of accounting and finance. Other beneficial credentials include the Certified Treasury Professional (CTP) certification and the </span><u style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent;\"><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/courses/chartered-financial-analyst/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chartered Financial Analyst</a></u><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"> (CFA) certification.

Attending industry events or joining professional organizations can help you connect with other professionals and industry leaders. This networking can lead to new opportunities for professional development, career advancement, and mentorship to further enhance your career.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"color: #434343; background-color: transparent;\">Build a Comprehensive Resume:</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">In your resume, emphasize your most recent relevant experiences. Many employers expect candidates to have at least eight to ten years of professional experience in finance or accounting to qualify for a CFO position, with some preferring prior leadership experience in those departments.

background-color: transparent;\">However, transitioning from a Controller to a CFO typically requires additional experience in higher-level strategic planning, capital management, and more direct involvement with the CEO and board of directors. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Gaining experience in areas like mergers and acquisitions, investor relations, and long-term financial strategy is often key to moving into the CFO role.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent;\">Who earns more: Financial Controller or CFO?</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">A CFO generally earns a higher salary than a Financial Controller. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">As an executive role, the CFO oversees the company’s long-term financial strategy, investment decisions, and risk management, often accompanied by a higher salary and additional compensation such as bonuses and stock options. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">On the other hand, the Financial Controller manages daily financial operations and reporting, focusing on tactical and operational tasks, which leads to a lower salary compared to that of the CFO.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent;\">Do small businesses need both a Controller and a CFO?</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Small businesses typically do not need both a Controller and a CFO, especially in the early stages. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">In most cases, one role can suffice based on the business’s size and financial complexity.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent;\">What is the difference between a CFO and a Finance Director?</span></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The key difference between a CFO (Chief Financial Officer) and a Finance Director is their level of responsibility and involvement in strategy. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">A </span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"><u>CFO</u></strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> is part of the executive leadership team and oversees the company’s overall financial strategy, long-term planning, investment decisions, and risk management, collaborating closely with the CEO and board. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

Financial leaders oversee the company’s capital mix, ensuring an ideal balance between debt and equity.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Achieving this balance is essential for maintaining financial stability, controlling costs, and fostering growth without overburdening the company with debt.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">Managing Debt, Equity, and Investment Strategies</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Part of managing corporate finance involves making decisions regarding debt issuance, equity funding, and investment strategies. </span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The CFO and financial leaders must assess the company’s capital requirements, analyze market conditions, and determine the most cost-efficient methods for raising capital, ensuring that the company’s capital structure supports its long-term strategic objectives.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">Raising Capital through Funding Rounds, Loans, or IPOs</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Raising capital is another critical responsibility of financial leadership. Whether through private funding rounds, securing loans, or preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), strategic financial leaders manage the process of raising necessary capital to fuel growth, innovation, and expansion. They work closely with investors, banks, and other stakeholders to ensure that the capital raised is used efficiently and effectively to drive the company’s objectives forward.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A)</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The next step for a strategic CFO is to explore ways to incorporate standardized databases and quantitative skills into </span><u style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/courses/fundamental-financial-planning-and-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A)</a></u><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. </span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">FP&amp;A is generally used to provide data-driven insights into financial and operational performance across various parts of the company. Some analyses are routine, like comparing the current period’s performance to the previous one, while others are more specific, such as evaluating the return on investment for a new sales technology platform. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A strategic CFO follows similar processes and addresses similar questions as a functional CFO, but with a more proactive approach.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">By utilizing FP&amp;A business intelligence tools like </span><u style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/courses/Data-analysis-using-advanced-excel-and-Power-bi/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Power BI</a></u><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, we will be able to pinpoint the primary sources of the highest growth, profits, and losses. We then will analyze these factors across various dimensions such as product category, SKU, customer, business unit, and region.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">Financial Reporting &amp; Compliance:</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A CFO is crucial in maintaining compliance in financial reporting. A proactive and thorough approach to compliance not only prevents problems but also fosters trust and credibility with stakeholders.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In general, financial statement compliance involves following established standards and regulations, like Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and guidelines from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">These standards ensure </span><u style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/courses/financial-statement-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">financial statements analysis</a></u><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, comparable, and transparent. A financial audit is the only legal way to confirm that statements are prepared in line with these principles.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Most small businesses cannot afford the cost of an annual financial audit, so they often opt for less comprehensive forms of compliance, such as reviews, compilations, or relying on internal controls. Without a financial audit, the CFO is solely responsible for managing all financial compliance risks. The level of this risk depends on factors such as:</span></p><p><br></p><ol><li data-list=\"bullet\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The existence of external investors or lenders.</span></li><li data-list=\"bullet\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The size and complexity of the business.</span></li><li data-list=\"bullet\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Whether the business plans to sell in the next five years.</span></li></ol><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Publicly traded companies must meet additional requirements like Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC regulations, but these generally do not apply to small businesses.</span></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/blog/cao-vs-cfo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Understand the </a><strong><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/blog/cao-vs-cfo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">differences</a></strong><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/blog/cao-vs-cfo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> between the </a><strong><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/blog/cao-vs-cfo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chief Accounting Officer (CAO)</a></strong><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/blog/cao-vs-cfo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> and the </a><strong><a href=\"https://360business-partners.com/blog/cao-vs-cfo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</a></strong>, two critical financial roles in any organization.

This includes conducting scenario analyses, establishing risk management frameworks, and ensuring adherence to legal and regulatory standards. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;

color: rgb(39, 39, 42);\">Strategic Planning and Analysis</strong></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The CFO plays a key role in the strategic planning phase of mergers and acquisitions, providing valuable insights into financial trends, market dynamics, and the strategic alignment of potential acquisition targets. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;

color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> is the highest-ranking employee within a company. </span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">While they work for the organization rather than being elected by shareholders, they hold a unique position of significant authority and influence, setting them apart from regular employees.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">However, in companies with strong corporate governance, the CEO does not wield unlimited power. Their decisions and actions are overseen by the Board of Directors, to whom they report and remain accountable.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The board, in turn, is elected by shareholders to ensure the organization operates in their best interests.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;

color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">With the </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><u>implementation of Saudi Vision 2030</u></strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, companies are increasingly seeking CFOs with strategic financial expertise, risk management capabilities, and technological proficiency. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As a result, compensation trends are shifting to reflect the growing complexity and importance of the role.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">One of the </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><u>key drivers of salary growth</u></strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> is the </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">increasing demand for financial leaders who can navigate digital transformation. </strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As automation, artificial intelligence, and fintech become more integrated into financial operations, CFOs with strong data analytics and technology skills will command higher salaries. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Additionally, performance-based compensation structures are becoming more common, with companies offering stock options, bonuses, and long-term incentive plans tied to key financial metrics such as revenue growth, cost efficiency, and capital optimization.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Another major factor influencing CFO salaries is the rise in </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><u>foreign direct investment (FDI)</u></strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> and globalization.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As Saudi Arabia continues to attract international businesses and expand its financial markets, companies will need CFOs who understand global financial regulations, cross-border transactions, and international investment strategies. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This will likely push CFO salaries closer to international benchmarks, making them more competitive with global markets.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><u>Industry disparities in compensation</u></strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> will also shape future salary trends.
